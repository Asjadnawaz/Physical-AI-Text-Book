# Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics: An Online Technical Textbook Constitution

## Core Principles

### Educational Clarity and Accessibility
Prioritize beginner-friendly language: Use simple explanations, real-world analogies (e.g., ROS 2 as the "nervous system" of a robot), and gradual introduction of technical terms. Concept-first approach: Explain ideas before introducing specific tools or code. Avoid overwhelming details: Limit code snippets, complex math, or advanced topics unless essential for understanding.

### Professional Structure and Flow
Strictly adhere to the predefined course outline: Include all specified sections (Preface/Introduction, Why Physical AI Matters, Course Overview, Modules 1–4, Capstone Project, Weekly Breakdown, Learning Outcomes, Assessments, Hardware Requirements). Logical progression: Build from basics (e.g., ROS 2 fundamentals) to advanced (e.g., Vision-Language-Action models) and integration (Capstone). Hierarchical organization: Use Docusaurus categories for modules and sub-sections for chapters.

### Content Quality and Consistency
Conceptual and non-technical tone: Focus on "why" and "what" rather than deep implementation. Where tools are mentioned (e.g., ROS 2, Gazebo, NVIDIA Isaac), emphasize purpose and high-level usage. Neutral and advisory: Avoid marketing language (e.g., no hype about tools or companies). Use simple, advisory tone for practical sections like Hardware Requirements. Inclusivity: Target students, hobbyists, and professionals new to Physical AI; highlight transformative potential (e.g., skill enhancement, not job loss).

### Technical Implementation Standards
Built with Docusaurus: Use Markdown/MDX files in a /docs folder with folder-based categories for hierarchy. Configure sidebars.js for nested navigation matching the outline. Single-instance docs plugin: No versioning initially; focus on current content. Readability enhancements: Include headings, lists, admonitions (e.g., notes, warnings), and optional diagrams (text-based or described for future images). SEO and usability: Clear titles, intros, and summaries per page.

### Compliance and Review
All content must align with this constitution. Before completion: Validate against checklist (all modules included, outline followed, clear explanations, logical flow, end-to-end capstone). Future expansions: Use SpecifyPlus workflows if extending (e.g., new features as specs).

## Governance
Amendments require explicit updates with semantic versioning (MAJOR for structural changes, MINOR for new content additions, PATCH for corrections).
