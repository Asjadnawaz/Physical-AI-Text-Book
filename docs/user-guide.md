## Text Selection Feature

One of the powerful features of this chatbot is the ability to ask questions about specific text on the page.

### How to Use Text Selection
1. Select text on the webpage by clicking and dragging over the text you're interested in
2. The selected text will appear in the chat input area with a preview

- "What does this mean in simpler terms?" (after selecting technical content)
- "Give me an example of this" (after selecting a theoretical concept)

## Understanding Responses

### Response Structure
Each response from the chatbot includes:
- **Content**: The answer to your question based on textbook content
- **Sources**: Links to the textbook sections that informed the response
- **Confidence Score**: A measure of how confident the chatbot is in its response (0-1 scale)

### Citations
When the chatbot provides information, it will often cite specific sections of the textbook. Look for references to chapters, sections, or page numbers that you can explore for more detail.

### Response Limitations
The chatbot only uses information from the Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics textbook. It cannot access external websites or general knowledge outside the textbook content.

## Tips for Best Results

### Formulating Questions
- Be specific with your questions for better results
- Ask about concepts you see on the current page
- Use text selection for contextual questions
- If you don't get the answer you expected, try rephrasing

### Using Context
- The chatbot remembers the context of your conversation
- You can refer to previous questions or answers in follow-up questions
- Starting a new session will clear the conversation history

### Getting More Information
- If a response seems brief, ask "Tell me more about this" or "Can you elaborate?"
- Use text selection to drill down into specific parts of the textbook content

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### "I couldn't find relevant content..."
- This means the chatbot couldn't find information in the textbook related to your question
- Try rephrasing your question
- Make sure your question is related to Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics topics
