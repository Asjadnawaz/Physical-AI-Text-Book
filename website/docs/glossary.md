# Glossary

This glossary contains comprehensive definitions of key terms used throughout the Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics textbook. The terms are organized alphabetically and cover fundamental concepts in Physical AI, robotics, control theory, biomechanics, and related fields.

## A

**Affordance** - The potential actions that an environment offers to an agent based on the agent's capabilities. This concept, developed by James Gibson, is crucial to understanding Physical AI as it emphasizes the relationship between an agent's physical form and the action possibilities available in its environment. Affordances are not properties of the environment alone, but emerge from the interaction between environmental features and the agent's capabilities. In humanoid robotics, affordances help determine what actions a robot can perform in a given environment based on its physical form and sensory-motor capabilities.

**Algorithm** - A step-by-step procedure for solving a problem or completing a task, especially in computing. In the context of Physical AI, algorithms must account for real-time constraints, sensor noise, and the continuous nature of physical interactions. Unlike traditional algorithms that operate on discrete symbolic data, algorithms in Physical AI must handle continuous state spaces and real-time processing requirements.

**Anthropomorphic Design** - The practice of designing robots with human-like characteristics, features, or behaviors. In humanoid robotics, anthropomorphic design involves creating robots that resemble humans in form, movement, or interaction patterns. This approach can facilitate natural human-robot interaction and enable robots to operate in human-designed environments, but it also presents significant engineering challenges.

**Artificial Intelligence (AI)** - The simulation of human intelligence processes by machines, especially computer systems. Physical AI represents a paradigm shift from traditional AI by emphasizing interaction with and understanding of the physical world rather than purely computational approaches.

**Autonomous System** - A system that can operate independently without continuous human control. In robotics, autonomous systems must perceive their environment, make decisions, and execute actions without human intervention, while adapting to changing conditions and handling unexpected situations.

## B

**Balance Control** - The ability of a humanoid robot to maintain its center of mass within its support polygon to prevent falling. This involves complex control algorithms that process sensory feedback from multiple sources including accelerometers, gyroscopes, and force sensors to maintain stability during both static and dynamic activities. Balance control is one of the most challenging aspects of humanoid robotics, requiring real-time processing and rapid response to perturbations.

**Biomechanics** - The study of the structure, function, and motion of the mechanical aspects of biological systems. In humanoid robotics, biomechanics provides insights into human movement patterns, joint mechanics, and the relationship between form and function that can inform robot design and control strategies. Understanding human biomechanics is essential for creating robots that can move and interact in human-like ways.

**Bipedal Locomotion** - The ability to walk on two legs. This form of locomotion is mechanically complex and requires sophisticated control strategies to maintain balance while moving. Bipedal locomotion in humans and humanoid robots involves coordinated movement of multiple joints and segments while maintaining dynamic stability.

**Body Schema** - The neural representation of one's own body that allows for spatial awareness and coordinated movement. In humanoid robotics, body schema refers to the robot's internal model of its own physical configuration and capabilities, which is essential for coordinated movement and interaction with the environment.

**Brain-Computer Interface (BCI)** - A system that enables direct communication between the brain and an external device. In the context of Physical AI, BCIs can be used to control robotic systems through thought alone, representing a direct connection between biological and artificial intelligence systems.

## C

**Center of Mass** - The point in an object or system where the mass is evenly distributed in all directions. For humanoid robots, maintaining the center of mass within the support polygon is critical for stability. The center of mass changes dynamically as the robot moves its limbs and torso, requiring continuous adjustment of posture and movement patterns.

**Cognitive Architecture** - The structural organization of an intelligent system's cognitive processes. In Physical AI, cognitive architectures must integrate perception, action, and learning in ways that are tightly coupled with physical interaction, rather than operating as separate modules.

Control theory is fundamental to robotics, providing the mathematical foundation for designing systems that can regulate their behavior to achieve desired outcomes.

**Degrees of Freedom** - The number of independent parameters that define the configuration or state of a physical system. In robotics, degrees of freedom refer to the number of independent movements a robot can make, typically corresponding to the number of joints or actuators. A typical human arm has 7 degrees of freedom, while humanoid robots often have 20+ degrees of freedom to achieve human-like mobility.

**Dynamic Balance** - The ability to maintain balance while in motion. Unlike static balance, which involves maintaining stability while stationary, dynamic balance requires continuous adjustment as the center of mass moves relative to the support base. This is essential for activities like walking, running, and other forms of locomotion.

## E

**Embodied Cognition** - The theory that cognitive processes are deeply rooted in the body's interactions with the world. This perspective challenges traditional views of cognition as computation independent of the physical substrate, instead proposing that thinking is fundamentally shaped by physical form and environmental interaction. In Physical AI, embodied cognition suggests that intelligence emerges from the dynamic interaction between an agent and its physical environment.

**Embodiment** - The concept that intelligence is shaped by the physical form and sensory-motor experiences of an agent. In contrast to disembodied AI systems that operate on abstract symbols, embodied systems must navigate the constraints and opportunities of physical reality, leading to fundamentally different approaches to learning, reasoning, and control.

**Enactivism** - A theory of cognition that emphasizes the active role of the agent in constructing its cognitive experience through interaction with the environment. Intelligence emerges from the dynamic coupling between agent and environment rather than being pre-programmed or computed internally. This perspective has profound implications for how we design and implement intelligent systems.
